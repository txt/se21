# Homework 1: Task Training 

  
  This document contains detailed descriptions on assignment 1. The purpose of this homework is to introduce the reuse in software engineering.

<img align=right src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29195/130092394-79518a84-0d7e-4763-9ef5-80f915512468.png" width=500> 

   
  
## Motivation
Do you think that any one SE subect can teach you **all** about SE? If so then you clearly have  a very high opinion of faculty at NC State (and I
thank you for that).



But,    the truth is, we cannot teach you it all. But we can teach you how you can learn, on an on-going basis, the parts of "it all" that
   interest you.

  
Understanding the current state of the art in software engineering  will be a challenge
for the rest of your career. Using _reuse graphs_ (edges connected papers  back to what they base their work  on), it is possible
for a community to find and maintain a shared understanding of
that state-of-the-art.

  <br clear=all>
  

To demonstrate this, in our Fall’21 classes,
we are leaving the second half of the lecture plan blank. We
will
let students find and define what cutting edge techniques will be
discussed there. To do so, their homework for theinitial three weeks
of class is to:

-  At first, learn this reuse graph approach by performing our standard “reuse graph 101”exercise. 
- Then in a second week, read some papers to find their reuse (if any); 
- Finally, in a third week, they should check someoneelse’s reuse findings from other papers

## Before You Start... Be Familiar with Reuse 
  Before you start your first assignment, please make sure you have already understand what is reuse, and the reuse type . https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/coding_guide.md contains the detailed description on the types of reuse, as well as some tips on identifying reuse.
  
## Working Steps...
  - Step 1: Please direct to the following link: https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/training.md
  - Step 2: Read the training material.
  - Step 3: Skim the four papers listed in that training document.
    - **Skim**, looking just for the reused bits. Do not **read** everything (unlesss you want to spend hours and hours on each paper).
    - **(Expectation Management: It may cost you one hour to skim the first paper since it's your first time to do this task. The skimming time of subsequent papers will reduce to 15-20 minutes after you got familiar with this task)**
  - Step 4: Record the reuse you identified in a .csv file with following format:
    | gh_id |  paper_doi  | reuse_type |       comment      | citation_number |  reused_doi  | alt_url | page_num |
    |-------|-------------|------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------|---------|----------|
    | xxxxx | https://... |   method   | replication of ... |        [1]      |  https://... |         |    150   |

## Hints

## Submission...
  Please submit your result .csv file to Moodle with following file name: **[First Name]-[Last Name]_HW1.csv** (e.g. Xiao-Ling_HW1.csv)
  
## Final Step...
  Now you can compare your results with the true labels: https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/results-sample.csv . After the comparison, please think about the missing or extra entries you made, and be ready for the future assignments.
  
  Please notice that the correctness will not affect your assignment score. This assignment is just for training purpose. So don't copy paste the correct entries into your result sheet.
